For our group project, we decided to create a website for a restaurant called GEVS. Although this website is not part of the group project, it serves as a personal endeavor to practice and reference the skills and knowledge gained from our collaborative efforts. The primary reason for selecting a restaurant theme was due to the nature of our group project, where we aimed to build an online presence for a restaurant, reflecting our interest in culinary arts and dining experiences.

Creating a website for GEVS allowed me to explore various aspects of web development, including front-end design, user experience, and interactive features. This project provided a valuable opportunity to apply the concepts learned during our group project in a real-world scenario. The objective was to develop a user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional website that could serve as an effective digital presence for the restaurant.

Choice of Styling
In designing the GEVS website, I opted for a simple and clean styling approach. The primary reason for this choice was to ensure the website remains accessible and easy to navigate for all users. A simple design minimizes distractions and helps users focus on the essential aspects of the website, such as the menu, services, and ordering process. Additionally, clean styling aligns well with modern web design trends, emphasizing readability, usability, and a pleasing aesthetic.

Using Bootstrap for styling provided a robust and responsive framework that ensured the website looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones. Bootstrap's grid system and pre-built components allowed for rapid development while maintaining a consistent look and feel throughout the site. This approach also ensured that the website adheres to best practices in web design, such as responsive design, cross-browser compatibility, and accessibility.

Difficulties Encountered
One of the main challenges I encountered while developing the GEVS website was embedding a video that showcases meal preparation. The initial difficulty was finding a suitable video that accurately represented the quality and atmosphere of GEVS. Once the video was selected, I faced technical challenges related to embedding and ensuring it played correctly across different devices and browsers.

The first issue was ensuring the video was responsive and fit well within the layout of the website. Embedding videos using HTML iframes can sometimes result in display issues, such as incorrect aspect ratios or overflow problems. To address this, I utilized Bootstrap's responsive embed classes, which provided a straightforward way to maintain the correct aspect ratio and ensure the video adjusted smoothly to different screen sizes.

Another challenge was dealing with browser compatibility. Different browsers can handle embedded media differently, leading to inconsistent playback experiences. Testing the embedded video across various browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, was necessary to identify and resolve any compatibility issues. In some cases, additional tweaks to the embed code and CSS were required to ensure consistent performance.

Furthermore, I encountered issues related to loading times and video playback performance. Large video files can slow down page loading times, negatively affecting user experience. To mitigate this, I ensured the video was hosted on a reliable platform, such as YouTube, which offers efficient video streaming and compression. Embedding the video from YouTube also provided built-in controls and optimizations for better playback performance.
